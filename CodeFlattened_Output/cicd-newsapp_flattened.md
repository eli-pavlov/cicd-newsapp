## \:star2: About the Project

This project delivers an **end-to-end CI/CD pipeline** for a Python Flask web app.

**Key Features & Goals:**

* GitOps-driven continuous deployment using Argo CD and Kustomize overlays.
* **Semantic, unique Docker image tags** per deployment (e.g., `dev-abc1234`, `latest-abc1234`).
* Multi-stage CI/CD with linting, unit tests, code quality (SonarCloud), and security (Snyk).
* **Automatic updates to [manifests repo](https://github.com/eli-pavlov/github-actions-cicd-manifests)** to trigger deployments via Argo CD.
* Supports both automated dev deployments and manual-approval prod deployments.

**Why GitHub Actions?**

| Feature                      | Justification                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üí∞ **Cost-effective**        | Free for public repos, generous for private projects                                |
| üîó **Native Integration**    | Tight GitHub ecosystem fit: PRs, branches, commits, secrets                         |
| üß∞ **Rich Ecosystem**        | Thousands of actions for Docker, Argo CD, SonarCloud, Snyk, Slack, and more         |
| üë®‚Äçüíª **Developer-Friendly** | Clean YAML, full commit history, branch-aware logic, easy rollbacks                 |
| üîí **Security**              | Encrypted secrets, support for environment approvals                                |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Scalable & Extensible** | Matrix jobs, reusable workflows, custom triggers, and environment-based deployments |

$\~\~\$

**Other tools used:**

* **GitOps:** [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/) for declarative Kubernetes deployment/version control.
* **Code Quality:** [SonarCloud](https://www.sonarcloud.io) for static analysis.
* **Security:** [Snyk](https://www.snyk.io) for IaC and dependency scanning.
* **Docker Hub** for image registry.

$\~\~\$

**Branching & Deployment Strategy:**

* `development`: Triggers full CI/CD pipeline, auto-deploys to development (K8s `development` namespace).
* `main`: Requires manual approval, deploys to production (`default` namespace).

$\~\~\$

## \:gear: CI/CD Workflow Overview

1. **Lint-and-Test**

   * Install dependencies, run `flake8`, execute unit tests with `pytest` + coverage.

2. **SonarCloud Analysis**

   * Perform static code analysis (using full git history).

3. **Snyk IaC Scan**

   * Scan Kubernetes manifests and Dockerfile for vulnerabilities.

4. **Build and Push Docker Image**

   * Build multi-arch Docker images (`dev-<sha>` or `latest-<sha>`).
   * Push image to Docker Hub.

5. **Update Manifests Repo (GitOps)**

   * Automatically update the correct overlay's `kustomization.yaml` in [github-actions-cicd-manifests](https://github.com/eli-pavlov/github-actions-cicd-manifests) with the new image tag.
   * Commit and push change.

6. **Argo CD Deployment**

   * Argo CD watches the manifests repo:

     * `/manifests/overlays/development` for dev
     * `/manifests/overlays/production` for prod
   * Syncs Kubernetes cluster with new image on change.

7. **Slack Notification (Optional)**

   * Post build/deploy status to Slack channel.

$\~\~\$

## \:wrench: How to Set It Up

### Prerequisites

* Fork or clone this repository.
* DockerHub account
* SonarCloud and Snyk accounts (optional, for quality/security)
* Kubernetes cluster with Argo CD installed and configured

### Steps

1. **Add required GitHub Secrets** (see [Secrets and Environments](#lock-secrets-and-environments)).
2. **Install Argo CD** on your cluster, if not already present.
3. **Apply Argo CD Applications** (see [manifests repo](https://github.com/eli-pavlov/github-actions-cicd-manifests)):

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f manifests/argocd/application-dev.yaml
   kubectl apply -f manifests/argocd/application-prod.yaml
   ```
4. **Push to `development`**: triggers auto-deploy to dev environment.
5. **Merge to `main`**: requires approval and deploys to production.

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
